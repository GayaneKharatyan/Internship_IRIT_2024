# Neurodegenerative Disease Diagnosis Research Repository

Welcome to the repository for the research conducted on neurodegenerative disease diagnosis, focusing on Parkinson's Disease (PD) and Multiple System Atrophy (MSA), at the Institut de Recherche en Informatique de Toulouse (IRIT).

## Overview

This repository contains all the data, Python codes, Perl scripts, and outputs generated during the research project. The research aimed to identify distinctive speech and vocal traits in patients with PD and MSA to contribute to the development of a non-invasive digital marker for early differentiation between these neurodegenerative conditions.

## Contents

### Data
- The dataset used in this research project comprises audio recordings of individuals reading "La Ch√®vre de Monsieur Seguin."
- Corpus Description:
  - Participants with MSA: 13 audio recordings
  - Participants with PD: 27 audio recordings
  - Healthy Controls: 20 audio recordings
- Additionally, a subset of recordings underwent manual processing for further analysis.

### Codes
- Python codes: These scripts were developed to extract audio features, train machine learning models, and analyze the data.
- Perl scripts: Used for running the python codes for all the data.
- Codes that weren't useful after understanding that automatic transcription doesn't work well: These codes were developed but deemed unnecessary due to limitations encountered during the research.

### Outputs
- Images: Charts, plots and spectrograms generated during data analysis and model training.
- CSV files: Data files containing extracted features, and other relevant information.

## Usage

To replicate the research findings or utilize the provided codes and data for further analysis, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the relevant directories for data, codes, or outputs.
3. Use the provided Python scripts for feature extraction, model training, and analysis.
4. Refer to the README files within each directory for specific instructions and guidelines.
